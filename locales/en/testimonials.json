    "Testimonial1": "Venla and I went to shoot my graduation photos, and I'm really happy with both the finished images and the shooting process! I was a bit nervous to step in front of the camera, but Venla created a relaxed and comfortable atmosphere so that I could relax and smile as I am. Before the shoot, I wasn't entirely sure what kind of pictures I wanted, but Venla gave me a lot of different ideas and listened to my wishes during the session, so I was pleasantly surprised to see what kind of great pictures you can get even in a nearby forest. The shoot lasted just under an hour, during which we had time to go around a lot of different locations and backgrounds. The photos were already ready and edited the very next day. All in all, the experience was amazing and really positive. Thank you so much to Venla for making this important day so memorable in such a professional way!",

Venla photographed our 20+50th birthday party in a lovely venue in the spring of 2023, and we have received nothing but positive feedback from everyone we have shared them with. Venla listened to our wishes and planned and secured everything in advance so that everything went smoothly at the party. At the event, Venla blended in and got some absolutely wonderful candid shots of the guests throughout the evening. The photos were edited with high quality and we received them quickly after the party. Venla captured our memories in a wonderful way and we can definitely recommend her for all kinds of occasions and events.",

    "Testimonial3": "It felt really safe to be photographed by Venla. I'm not used to being in front of the camera, but Venla encouraged and praised me in just the right ways, and frankly, I got some incredible photos. The pictures still portrayed the real me, so she managed to reach my true self and capture it beautifully. She took a proactive stance and made good suggestions during the shoot, but still listened to my wishes and ideas with a sensitive ear. I am very satisfied and can definitely recommend Venla as a photographer.",
